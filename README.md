# Thesis-Code
In order to run this code, in "Setup", all the imports must be done so the following functions work. Then, you can run any cell with bulleted pros and cons lists you want. You can also make a new one with any pros and cons you want from articles.
Then, in "Algorithm for Visualization", you need to go to the four lines after "combined[]". There, you will insert the pros from your first article on the first line, the cons on the second line, the pros of the second article on the third line, and the cons in the last line. Running the code will download a png of the visualization in your downloads.
In "Full Pros/Cons List Algorithm", on the first line, add the pros from both articles, and on the second line the cons from both articles.
With all of this, you will have access to a visualization and a complete pros/cons list.
